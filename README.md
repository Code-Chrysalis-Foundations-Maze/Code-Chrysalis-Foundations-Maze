## __The Project__
a-MAZE-ing is a game-like experience built using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

To access it, simply open the `src/index.html` file in the browser of choice.

## __The Goal__
To help users understand computer logic.

## __How to use it__

* Navigate the arrow through the maze using only two commands, __forward__ and __rotate__;
* Insert all the necessary input at once;
* Press __execute__ and watch the result of your logic!
* Feeling insecure about the pattern you chose? __Reset__ it by clicking __clear canvas__.

## __Contacts__
